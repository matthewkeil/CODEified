It all begins with an idea.


“We the People, in Order to find a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution.”


Beautiful in its simplicity and thoroughness. It encompasses government’s purpose. Nothing more and nothing less. This is what the end goal of The Freedom Project should be. Nothing more and nothing less. 
Thorough enough to cover all the necessities of a complex world and simple enough for each individual to understand so the will to participate persists. A solid foundation from which we can build, yet flexible to recognise that mistakes are made and opinions can change. After all we are human. All of us… We the People are just a group of people in the eyes of something greater any individual. Transparent in its creation so nothing unwanted can usurp our will and CODEified by each of us so that we may hold ourselves, each other, and shared institutions accountable to The Will of We the People. 
Frustration is all around us. Government at the moment is both the problem and the purported solution.  What I say is that we have not figured out how to make a “perfect” government, no less have we come to agreement on what government should even be doing.  If you are reading this my guess is that you agree.  I am not arrogant enough to think that I have all of the answers but this is my idea for how we can work together to figure it out.  Humanity has attempted to organise itself throughout history. We have gotten some idea right and many more wrong but the end result is that we still haven’t figured it out yet. We haven’t found a government that works for all people, in all situations otherwise there would not be the confusion and frustration that we all see around us today.
Many point to America for being a great example of what government should look like but if it is soo perfect then why is there so much frustration. So much divisiveness on both sides of the isle. We need to figure this out and The Freedom Project’s aim is to create a map of sorts. A way to organize our ideas, beliefs, principles, rules and laws so that we may find a more perfect solution.  If we are to hold our leaders accountable then we will need a measuring stick with which they guide their actions, taken on our behalf. I pose that to make this plan it will take inclusive discussion. A major piece of this project is the roundtable at which we will sit to have a new Constitutional Convention.
Our founders did it the old fashioned way. They got together in a room and hashed it out until they arrived at a solution and then they wrote it down. They reviewed it, hashed it out some more and changed what they wrote. They repeated that process until that came up with a solution that was worthy of codification.  This is the basic premise that The Freedom Project will follow, with one caveat. Computers, and the internet have given us powerful new tools to communicate and organize. This is merely a modern extension of what was done the first time. It is both a forum with which we can discuss our ideas and a framework to document our will.


Ideas, Beliefs, Principles, Rules and Laws
        We are conscious beings. Our eyes see, our ears hear, but our consciousness is locked away in our brains.  Our understanding of how the brain works advances daily and we know how our visual and auditory cortices process the world.  We see how they store the information we see in our memory centers but we still don’t understand the nature of consciousness. Where “the spark” comes from.  It is this lack that forces me to use a metaphor to represent how our consciousness gets access to the world around us through use of the physical structures in our brains.  I call it “the lens of perception.”  To me the lens of perception is the physical wiring of our brain and how our consciousness is connected to the outside world.  It has to use the visual cortex to gain access to the impulses delivered from our eyes.  It has to use our stored memories to get access to our past experiences and it is the wiring of these experiences, and the rest of the organ that physically comprise this lens.
        We don’t get to choose what information the environment provides us but we do get to choose what to do with it.  This choice is a critical idea.
It all begins with ideas. I pose that ideas are the fundamental quantity on which everything else is based.  Ideas build on other ideas.  Choices are made based on understanding of ideas.  Ideas and choices combine to guide behaviors.  So it is here that everything begins.  We must choose what to do with the idea though. Should we accept it, reject it, use it, act upon it or not, etc.
        Beliefs are ideas at their core, but more importantly they are ideas that the individual has taken into their understanding.  It is only after an ideas is held as part of our understanding that we can build upon it to form other beliefs or to guide our actions.  We as humans use relation to understand the world around us.  Our brains are non-linear, biological, relational databases. We relate one idea to another on a physiological level when the axon of one neuron connects to another neuron.  It’s how the brain physically works.  When we see something new our brains search through our understanding and relate to our existing understanding so it can be incorporated into our now expanded understanding of the world.  A belief is the representation of this process.  Only after something is held as a belief can it be used further.  








How it works
Each of us will CODEify our own Constitution. It will be the law that we choose to live our life by. All laws will be phrased from the perspective of the individual (I, My, Me, You, Others, etc.) so it is easy to understand. 


Ex. “I will not kill another human” or “I will not steal”


As each of us agrees to live by a 






















Many smart, but more importantly learned individuals, have worked on this idea before us. It on the shoulders of these giants that we will stand.  We the People is one of the most important ideas in governance and it is where I suggest we begin.  The Preamble of the Constitution (the US Constitution has been used as a basis of liberty for most democratic constitutions currently in existence) is composed of six separate ideas. Each of these ideas will be a heading under which everything else will be filed.  If an idea doesn’t fall under one of these topics than I pose that it should not be part of government.












 t is beautiful in its simplicity and thoroughness for answering the question of “why?”  “Why should I participate in this organization?”


By taking The Preamble to the Constitution and using it as a framework to organize our thoughts, beliefs, principles, rules and laws it will allow us to decide what government should do. All law should stem from the same why and this is how I pose we organize each of our CODEified understanding of how to lead our lives.




The Framework
---------------------
We The People…
* In order to find a more perfect Union
* Establish justice
* Insure domestic tranquility
* Provide for the common defense
* Promote the general welfare
* Secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our posterity
… do ordain and establish this Constitution.


That is the why, now we must talk with each other to figure out the how.




The discussion
--------------------
When the original framers created the above they did so through discussion. When emotions get involved, as they should when deciding the fate of each of our lives, there needs to be a way to organize the discussion. We need a proper round table, and a ma

==========  Cut and Paste Working Area ============
The constitution of the United States was a marvel of its time. A guide to freedom. We the People. We still look at it with reverence but we also all realize that today is a new age. The world is changing soo fast around us that it is hard to keep up. It is hard for our governing structures to keep up as well. The beauty of The Constitution was its ability to represent We the People and to change with us as we grew and changed our minds and attitudes.  This was the purpose of the Amendment process.  To allow us to change our minds if We the People deemed it so.


If this was the original intention of the framers, that the document was flexible, then this should be our attempt to keep true to their original wishes. That our government, and those who govern us, represent us in our current form and with full view of our shared history.  A keen on on the past and what has worked for us before is important to 










I pose that ideas are a fundamental quantity that we can build upon. Ideas build on idea but first we must choose to accept them into our understanding of the world before we can use them as building blocks. Ideas are wrapped in acceptance and become beliefs. Beliefs that we guide our actions with are principles and principles that we think others should live by are rules. Once we democratically vote for a rule it become law. That is the tricky part.


Instead of building from the top down I pose that we build from the bottom up.  I think we must begin with a government of one. CODEifiy our own law. The law that we live our life by and then the “system” (a DAO) will help us aggregate individual will into the Will of the People.


Each individual must buy-in on their own. Free will is the basis of all that we choose to share and all that we choose to not to share. We must each willingly join, or not, and we must all willingly accept The Will of the People. Without individual acceptance The Will will not be representative of our shared understanding (at our own level, paramount that each of us understand why we choose what we choose) of compromise.

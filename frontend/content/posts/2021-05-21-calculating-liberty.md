Freedom is free, but not exactly. We can be as free as we want, assuming we are in a civilized society, as long as our freedom doesn't make someone else "less free." Like my freedom can't hinder your freedom. That's THE social contract. One of the key unspoken rules of living together peacefully.

Don't tread on me and I, my neighbor, will not tread on you. Deal.

That is Liberty. My freedom in the context of your freedom and when we get that perfectly "right" such that no one treads on anyone else then, I believe we will be in utopia. Which isn't a real place. But, it is a hell of a goal to shoot for and "when you shoot for the stars, at least you'll get the moon."

This is also where a lot of the current "overstep" of government comes in. No one wants to be told what to do when it literally does NO ONE harm. Motorcycle helmets are a good example. Whom is hurt by not wearing a motorcycle helmet? Whom should be able to make that decision. Whom is a fucking idiot for riding a motorcycle without a helmet? One and the same. But none of my business. I think **their** insurance premiums should be higher, not **mine** though... and all of that should be taken into account in life. It's what feels "fair" to me.

Nudity is another example. It's an issue that has a wide range of opinions across the world. Nudity is something that has very little real "harm" if we are seen naked, or see others' naked. There can be an "emotional" harm aspect of it, but in reality it has very little burden other than the societal burden imposed by the culture where the nudity occurred. Anyone who has been to a beach in Brazil and one in Indonesia understands how widely the answer is to the question "what is appropriate clothing for going in the ocean, or sitting on the beach?"

Laws are built around making those boundaries "culturally safe" for the society. We make overarching declarations to protect the idea of "freedom of the people" and trample all over the will of the individual. What do ideas in one part of the country have to do with right here where I'm standing? Why should your "offense" affect me one damn bit, here on my own land. It shouldn't is the answer. And when you come on my land understand how you are supposed to act.

When the idea of "writing down and arguing out our laws" came to be, writing was the best that we could do. So we sat down and wrote everything out, and after several generations of societal collapse (think since ancient Greece) we figured out a few good things that keeps us living peacefully amongst each other. But that is the thing. When we wrote down our laws we did so with broad strokes. Sure they are nuanced but the argument of "society being protected" or "freeing the individual" its hard to write down every nuance and calculation to get the balance perfectly correct.

It's like old school engineering. We used to build stuff to tight tolerances and things lasted a long time. But not like things today. We can build things to such high quality that we change oil in cars more than 3x less frequently. Things "just fit together" well so you have less wear thus less sludge builds up in the oil. Also the oil doesn't burn the same because of materials science. We've just gotten better doing things with innovation and computers played a HUGE part.

Computers do something really important. They allow us to invent and innovate more rapidly. They also allow us to create much more complex things. Think about engines on cars from the 60's and engines on cars today. That happened because pof computer aided design, CAD for short and AutoCAD made it popular. Now its how everything is made. I learned to draft in engineering school. Like lost time learning how to draw in 3D to represent my ideas. The software has made that skill irrelevant and now there are hours and hours spent learning the software instead. And the software is where the magic is. Be doing all the tedium, like setting up isomorphic views to visualize 3d things on a 2d paper. And instead of us spending time doing that terribly boring, difficult and error prone task we spend time innovating and inventing. We also can build things in much greater detail and with much much more information attached.

The computers allow us to organize very very very large sets of data efficiently. Think about spreadsheets and hum much better they are at handling tables of data than that huge book we remember. Whether it was and an uncles business, or at the restaurant, dentists office, etc, it was huge and full of pages with lots and lots of lines on it. With scratched out areas and arrows with write-ins. Computers are much better with this kind of stuff. But more importantly they do things that we cannot do.

I watched a speech by a guy that worked for a big bank, not my favorite people, but insight is insight none-the-less. He said "computer used to be important to our business but now they are integral. They used to do things humans didn't want to do and now they do things that humans cannot do. Algorithmic and high-frequency trading, for instance." This is critical. For better or worse, computers are getting better at certain things that we can do them. Organizing large sets of data is one of those things. Databases vs filing cabinets makes the spreadsheet example seem silly.

This is where liberty comes into play... we used to make laws to "calculate freedom" with pens and paper. What I say is we can do better. If I want to go skinny dipping, and no one is around, what harm is it? If there is a nude beach and someone has noted on their personal contract that they are offended by nudity, they will be notified that they are about to be harmed and to proceed at their own caution. If for example a local population votes to ban nudity. If on my contract I've elected that I don't have a problem with nudity, and I go to that district I can find the "differences" between "my laws" and the "local laws" and the nudity would show up. Furthermore I am in a place with no laws "for or agains" nudity and want to be on a beach naked, and no one is there why can't I be naked. If a curmudgeon arrives and "reports that its a problem," my app will notify me and tell me someone is being "harmed."

Real-time calculation of the boundary between my freedom and yours. Within my own locus of control I can be as free as I can be. Only when you approach, will that boundary need to be calculated so we can be as feee as each of us can be in that moment. It should be calculated in real time as well (ie. how you and I feel about something can change over time. The calculation should take that into account). For more info on locus of control, see the post about [self aggregating jurisdictions](/posts/self-aggregating-jurisdictions).

By not having to write catch-all laws, that attempt to take all situations into account, we can fine tune what liberty looks like. We can minimize the amount of harm we have as individuals in service of protecting people that either aren't actual near, or don't really care. Like laws that protect 5% of the vocal people and the rest of us have to deal with it ALL of the time. We have the burden even when those people aren't anywhere to be found.

It's time to better take that into account.

Look between your two feet. Go ahead. Now tell me where you can find a "list" of the laws that apply to that square of dirt? I double dog dare you.

The answer is it's "impossible" to technically do it because only half of our laws are "written down." The other half are jurisprudence. Like judges, court cases, precedent, ya know politics. Have you noticed how rich people seem to get away with shit more often then the rest of us? How is it they get "special exceptions" and we get to play by the rules like everyone else? They hide in plain sight, behind jurisprudence.

When one is wealthy they can hire lots of layers, and those lawyers can read old cases and do a lot of homework on issues. Then they use that information as both shield and cudgel. They "beat" us by forcing/convincing judges to rule in their favor. And they do so with legal precedent and high-dollar lawyer speak. They hide behind the law and then turn it against others if they are vicious.

There is also the issue of the hugely disorganized federal bureaucracy that hoses all of the "written parts." Its hugely disadvantageous to those without direct access to this information. And I'm not even talking about access to the people who write all these laws, what I mean is actual access to just read them. This is 2021. The internet is not exactly new anymore. We can do better at this.

Why does it cost hundreds of dollars to get copies of building codes when we literally pay for them to be written with our tax dollars? Why is there not a website where the discussion can happen in the open. Where all of the rulings, substantiating evidence, the legal precedent is all provided as links so that anyone can see what went into the decision to make all entrance doors 30" wide. I'm a law abiding citizen and I like to follow the rules. I'm also an inquisitive person and deserve the explanation of "why" I should just trust some random rule written by an apparatchik.

How does this pertain to corruption you ask? I'm glad you did. Take my experience with yogurt for instance.

Yogurt is a naturally fermented food that has been made, for a long, long time. Well before the State of Florida decided that only someone with roughly $1M dollars worth of equipment can make safely. Who made that law? The milk lobby is my guess but you would have to ask the likely corrupt agricultural something or other why they made that particular regulation?

Laws are either written to make "the game" more fair or less fair.

There are many places that corruption hides behind the legal system. It's time for a change. It's time for us to shine a light in the dark corners of our creaking attic. It's time to have a discussion about what it means to be American. What it means to be coddled or/and confused. By design, we are all left pointing at each other as the problem but I say a good dusting of of the system will do us all some good. There are a lot of laws on the books and many many are hard fought and good legislation. Freedom, up to this point was not free. It has been hard earned and we should use this as an opportunity to celebrate our freedom.

It's time we import our existing system and go through it with a fine tooth comb. It will be the beginning of a new civic era. One where public works is an honor. Where scouring, debating, and discussing what makes us free, our legal system, is the highest goal in the land. The tree of liberty must be refreshed but this time with the dreams and hopes of a generation, not the blood of tyrants and patriots.

When certain types of complex situations are analyzed, a shape of data can be helpful for us to make sense of the data. If you have seen a detective movie where they have the wall with clues and pinned photos as well as string connecting the clues. That is called a graph. Not the kind from school with the x and y axes, it's called an [asymmetric graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_graph). There are whole sub-fields of mathematics and data science that study graph theory. Graphs are hugely important for many reasons but for our case they are relevant as it's how the brains stores and represents data.

Laws are written to affect behavior. They are, and should be, careful about stopping us from saying or thinking things, but they do seek to control our behaviors. Don't sell yogurt because it's unsafe, yada yada. I can talk about yogurt, I can and do think about yogurt but I just can't make and sell it commercially here.

We feel what we see (read, watch). We believe what we feel. We act how we believe we should.

Act this way, when that other thing happens. Then stop once its over.

The simple fact is, our system has gotten bloated and laden with its own success and it's time to clean out the pipes. By importing all of our laws, In the process of celebrating and discussing what has made us free we will get the chance to talk about our existing laws and give them a sniff test.

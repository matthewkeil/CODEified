Staying in one place seems a bit boring. The world is full of wonder and life is short. Let it be one full of beauty and life. This is THE goal.

Digital nomads are a special bread of bastard; wild and free, unencumbered in our own ways. Yet from those I've met along my journey there is a sense of camaraderie that binds us. Binds us and we are never alone when we are around each other. We all have our reasons for wandering the world. And we sense it in each other, a shared understanding of the human condition. A shared belief in the good we see in each other instantly. Like gosh darn really good good! It's part of why we don't want to stop. The people we surround ourselves with. We are a special breed in the world. We instigate togetherness. Everything else we do is in service to that. Slaves and miserable no more we will spread our joy through good deeds and integrating into the local community that hosts us. There is much good we can do as we go. Even if that is simply helping them understand how to navigate the digital world.

There are so many facets of digital nomadism that exist. I'm a coder and love to teach. This is what I want to do, teach others to code. It's my passion and I will gladly do it for free. But you know how to do something too... bring your skills and travel with us. Cryptoverse, marketing, sales, virtual assistance, teaching, virtual nurse, benevolence, soo soo many. Each with our own journey and just here for the journey. If others have questions they can ask us and we can tell them our story. How we got to what we do today so they can decide if that is the path for them. This is a huge thing. Choosing what path is right for each of us. I view life through the lens of a developer.

Development/Programming
Self-Starters and our get up and go is what gets us where we go. As a self-taught developer there was something I missed. A tutor. It's a super super important thing to make the journey efficient. Learning to code is a HUGE undertaking that takes time. Short as. As long as one understands that going in they can make the honest assessment (I might add that I didn't do) of do I know how to teach myself this mountain of knowledge. In my case the answer was both yes AND no. Clearly yes, ultimately, but I did not go about it correctly. I flat out wasted a ridiculous amount of time. I learned things in the wrong order was my issue. I started trying to learn angular and rxjs right out of the box. Like never coded and scratched my head trying to understand why Angular2 looked so different from 1.5 and why neither really looked like "javascript." It was frankly a shitshow not knowing where the error was coming from, ie js, ts, webpack, angular, vscode, etc..... like nightmare. I once read a quote that learning to code with Angular2 is like learning a video game on insane mode. They were not wrong. Needless to say, you may want to skip this particular path "to developer"

After a couple of years fighting with things and making it all work I ended up in a bootcamp. It was good, don't get me wrong, but my competition AND the "teacher" of the course did worse on my job interview coding challenge. Wtih that said, they got me the interview and showed me how to use linkedIn to get a tech job so that was worth the money I paid them. For someone that has 0, or little coding experience, the bootcamps do a good job of laying out a road map. The bug but is that many of the grads don't get hired right out of school. Some do for sure but it's usually the top couple candidates in each course. Usually those are the few people that have prior coding experience, and vioala, you have the conundrum. Either you learn before you go or you learn after you go. But ultimately it's up to you to put the time in. You need to build repos. You need to know how to handle the tools and understand the jargon. Key being the "walk the walk" part... Then to find a client or an entry level job

That is when life gets much much easier. Remote work is PLENTIFUL. Like stupidly so. But training, monitoring and making very novice coders productive is hard remote. So getting ones foot into the door is the key; having stripes on ones shoulders. Been there, debugged that. Getting to this hurdle can be as I explained above. Self-directed and isolated, or in a costly boot camp. Enter nomad house. Bootcamp mixed with meetup mixed with remote year. This is not us standing in front of a class slapping a ruler. This is you are working, get to an error, and turn around to ask the 1 min answer from a Sr. Dev. Instead of what I did.

1. Look up error
2. scratch head
3. figure out its is a webpack error
4. get frustrated fighting webpack
5. take 2 weeks to lear wtf webpack is
6. go on my neurotic way

Like I didn't need to be a webpack expert, but I didn't need that friggin' error to go away to proceed. Being here saves you the two weeks. And in our now-free extra time we explore the city we are living in (think Salsa dancing or yoga in india). We facilitate self-learning coders. Self-Learning coders are also those who may want a non-threatening place to retool. Learn some now things. Try a new language maybe. Get away from the office while you are working remotely around other nomad coders. Or people who like to help other learn. There are lots of questions, and we have resources ready to help but nothing is as good as an old fashioned conversation. Win win all the way around and we get to talk about what we love to nerd out about!!

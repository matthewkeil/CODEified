Explain a meandering conversation and how I cam up with the realization that my stories overlapped.

I was actually explaining my "idea for liberty" albeit badly because its too big of an idea to expound upon. It needs to be broken down into smaller pieces to be discussed properly.

By pontificating we build a graph of our belief on a topic. Our elocution will be a relation of the topic at hand with how it affects, relates, impinges and otherwise impacts the interrelated ideas, beliefs, actions, etc in the discussion. This idea relates to that idea under some set of circumstances.

An ideas is graphs. The relation of one or more different ideas, potentially mixed with it's relation to the current situation can be accurately represented as an asymmetric graph. A mind map. If one was to explain their opinion on a topic, the discussion would take a similar shape [explanation video](/404). So if we all talk about a particular topic each of us will discuss our opinions. There will be some where they overlap and some where there will be new information provided. New light shed on the topic.

Universal understanding is the aggregated graph of every point of view of all contributors.

When certain types of complex situations are analyzed, a shape of data can be helpful for us to make sense of the data. If you have seen a detective movie where they have the wall with clues and pinned photos as well as string connecting the clues. That is called a graph. Not the kind from school with the x and y axes, it's called an [asymmetric graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_graph). There are whole sub-fields of mathematics and data science that study graph theory. Graphs are hugely important for many reasons but for our case they are relevant as it's how the brains stores and represents data.

Laws are written to affect behavior. They are, and should be, careful about stopping us from saying or thinking things, but they do seek to control our behaviors. Don't sell yogurt because it's unsafe, yada yada. I can talk about yogurt, I can and do think about yogurt but I just can't make and sell it commercially here.

We feel what we see (read, watch). We believe what we feel. We act how we believe we should.

Act this way, when that other thing happens. Then stop once its over.

The simple fact is, our system has gotten bloated and laden with its own success and it's time to clean out the pipes. By importing all of our laws, In the process of celebrating and discussing what has made us free we will get the chance to talk about our existing laws and give them a sniff test.
